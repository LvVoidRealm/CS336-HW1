			<p>
				Playing alone in a video game world is often fun but having a friend or two can make it even more fun, if not chaotic.
				When video games started, the concept of a 2nd player was always a couch co-op kind of thing, but eventually it led to development of multiplayer games over the internet and <abbr title="massively multiplayer online">MMO</abbr> games.<br><br>
				Back on the fun concept of arcade machines, multiplayer was quite common especially for fighting games like streetfighter. However the first multiplayer arcade machine was the Atari Firetruck. <br>

				Obviously home consoles also had multiplayer between 2-4 players, however this required everyone to meet up in the same area (usually your living room couch) and play.<br>
				This usually lead to the beauty that is the LAN party where people gather with their own computers and all connect to the same network, giving them fast connection to one another as it didn't need to transfer over the internet.<br>

				When online games first game out, they weren’t too big as they are now due to the fact the internet wasn’t fast enough as it couldn’t send data in a reasonable manner. Once the internet improved, so did online gaming.
				One noticeable type of genre was the MMO. Games like <abbr title=World of Warcraft>WOW</abbr> allowed multiple people to play together in online servers with 24/7 access.

				<br><br>
				MMOs aren’t the only form of online gaming, most games today have their own dedicated servers created by their developers. Some of these games will last for years or sometimes will die if the games aren’t popular enough. Obviously, there are many forms of online play like <abbr title=Peer to Peer>P2P</abbr> or Server-based.
