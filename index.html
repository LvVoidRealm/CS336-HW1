			As the rise of computers advanced, so did video games. From 2D sprites to 3D, fully rendered worlds, and from 8-bit graphics to 4k realism. Video games have shown significant change in the past 30 years. To say it as a single topic would be a disservice to the gaming industry, as so many parts of video games of today have advanced the industry altogether.
			<br/><br/>
			Video games stand on the shoulders of giants, as they are the culmination of a lot of hard work and ingenuity. Instead of reading a book and wondering what the world would be like, you can play in that world with video games. Same applies for movies, but your actions are your own, not a scripted one (albeit some games are linearly crafted.)
