				Arcades: Before the home console, the initial start of video games was the founding console itself, the arcade machine. <br/><br/>
				These machines always had a certain charm to them, from wacky button layouts to over-the-top theatrics. These machines have a soft spot in everyone’s heart, though they merely requested a quarter per play initially, they had a lot of games that were designed to suck the coins out of your pocket (or cup.) While they are still available to play in modern game locations, people collect for the sake of nostalgia and they tend to grasp everyone’s vision with their colorful displays.

					Home consoles started with the Magnavox Odyssey, while it didn’t have a CPU or Memory, it did allow one of the most classic games to play which was Pong. It also featured plug-in game cards. It also had a surprising amount of video games for being the first console with 28 games.

					The first home console to feature a CPU was the “Fairchild Channel F.” While it is an 8-bit system, it is not regarded as the first official 8-bit console. However, it was the first console to show off swappable game cartridges.
